- **Default Values:** Sensible defaults for optional fields

---

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Database Constraints
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with proper cascade rules
- ✅ Unique constraints on critical fields
- ✅ NOT NULL constraints on required fields
- ✅ Check constraints for status values and ranges

### 2. Performance Optimization
- ✅ Indexes on frequently queried columns
- ✅ Composite indexes for common query patterns
- ✅ Optimized table structure for SQLite

### 3. Data Validation Framework
- ✅ Comprehensive cleanup scripts for future use
- ✅ Verification queries for ongoing monitoring
- ✅ Backup procedures established

---

## Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance

### 1. Regular Monitoring
- Run integrity checks monthly
- Monitor for orphaned records
- Check for constraint violations

### 2. Automated Cleanup
- Schedule regular cleanup scripts
- Implement data validation in application layer
- Set up alerts for data quality issues

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance
- Add indexes as needed
- Regular database maintenance
