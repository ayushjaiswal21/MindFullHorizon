To create the new `notifications` table after adding the `Notification` model:

1. Activate your virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure `FLASK_APP` is set (or use `export`/`set` accordingly):

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $env:FLASK_APP = 'app.py'
   ```

3. Create a migration and apply it using Flask-Migrate (Alembic):

   ```powershell
   flask db migrate -m "Add notifications table"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

If your project does not use Flask-Migrate migration scripts in CI, you can create the table manually using a small script or by inspecting the SQL generated by Alembic.
