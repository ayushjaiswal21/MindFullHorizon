# Enhanced Mood Audio Filtering - Implementation Guide

## 🎵 Overview
The mood audio filtering system has been significantly enhanced to provide better audio recommendations based on mood selection. The previous system only worked well for "happy" and "sad" moods - now all moods (happy, sad, angry, calm, anxious, focus) work with comprehensive filtering.

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Mood Mapping
- **Comprehensive Keywords**: Each mood now has multiple related keywords for better matching
- **Brainwave Association**: Moods are mapped to appropriate brainwave frequencies
- **Frequency Ranges**: Each mood has optimal frequency ranges defined
- **Priority Frequencies**: Most effective frequencies for each mood are prioritized

#### Mood Configuration Example:
```python
'focus': {
    'keywords': ['alpha', 'beta', 'focus', 'concentr', 'study', 'work', 'attent', 'alert'],
    'brainwaves': ['alpha', 'beta'],
    'freq_range': (8.0, 30.0),  # Alpha: 8-12 Hz, Beta: 12-30 Hz
    'priority_freq': [10.0, 12.0, 15.0, 20.0]
}
```

### 2. Advanced Filtering Options
- **Frequency Range Filter**: Min/Max Hz filtering (e.g., 10-20 Hz)
- **Audio Type Filter**: Pure, Isochronic, Solfeggio
- **Multiple Sorting Options**:
  - Relevance (default - based on mood matching score)
  - Frequency (ascending/descending)
  - Duration (long tracks first)
  - Brainwave type (Delta → Theta → Alpha → Beta → Gamma)

### 3. Relevance Scoring System
Tracks are scored based on:
- **Brainwave Match** (+10 points): Track's brainwave matches mood's optimal brainwaves
- **Priority Frequency** (+5 points): Track frequency matches mood's priority frequencies
- **Keyword Match** (+3 points): Track filename contains mood-related keywords

### 4. Filter Persistence
- **localStorage Integration**: Filter settings are saved and restored across page reloads
- **User Preferences**: Frequency ranges, sorting preferences, and other filters persist
- **Reset Functionality**: Easy reset to default filters

### 5. Enhanced UI Controls
- **Frequency Range Inputs**: Min/Max Hz sliders with validation
- **Sort Selector**: Dropdown with multiple sorting options
- **Filter Display**: Shows brainwave info, frequency, relevance score
- **Reset Button**: Clears all filters and preferences

## 🚀 API Enhancements

### Enhanced `/api/mood-audio` Endpoint
The API now accepts additional parameters:

```json
{
  "mood": "focus",
  "min_frequency": 10,
  "max_frequency": 20,
  "type": "pure",
  "sort_by": "frequency_asc"
}
```

### Response Format
Each audio file now includes detailed metadata:

```json
{
  "url": "/audio/Alpha_10_Hz.mp3",
  "filename": "Alpha_10_Hz.mp3",
  "label": "Alpha 10 Hz",
  "length_hint": "short",
  "type": "pure",
  "brainwave": "alpha",
  "frequency": 10.0,
  "solfeggio_frequency": null,
  "relevance_score": 13
}
```

## 🎯 Mood-Specific Improvements

### Fixed Mood Mappings:

1. **Happy** 🎉
   - Brainwaves: Alpha (8-12 Hz), Gamma (30+ Hz)
   - Keywords: happy, joy, uplift, positive, energiz, boost
   - Best for: Mood elevation, energy boost

2. **Calm** 😌
   - Brainwaves: Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz)
   - Keywords: calm, relax, peace, meditat, sleep, rest
   - Best for: Relaxation, meditation, sleep

3. **Focus** 🎯
   - Brainwaves: Alpha (8-12 Hz), Beta (12-30 Hz)
   - Keywords: focus, concentr, study, work, attent, alert
   - Best for: Concentration, productivity, learning

4. **Anxious** 😰
   - Brainwaves: Theta (4-8 Hz), Delta (0.5-4 Hz) - calming frequencies
   - Keywords: anxiety, stress, tension, worry, calm, sooth
   - Best for: Anxiety relief, stress reduction

5. **Sad** 😢
   - Brainwaves: Theta (4-8 Hz), Delta (0.5-4 Hz) - healing frequencies
   - Keywords: sad, melanchol, blue, depress, comfort, heal
   - Best for: Emotional healing, comfort

6. **Angry** 😠
   - Brainwaves: Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz) - calming frequencies
   - Keywords: anger, rage, frustrat, calm, cool, release
   - Best for: Anger management, emotional cooling

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Dataset
A comprehensive test dataset (`tracks.csv`) includes 30 diverse tracks:
- Various brainwave types (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- Different audio types (Pure, Isochronic, Solfeggio)
- Frequency range: 1-80 Hz
- Multiple mood associations

### Test Script
Run `test_mood_filtering.py` to validate the implementation:

```bash
python test_mood_filtering.py
```

The script tests:
- All mood types with their respective filtering
- Frequency range filtering
- Sorting functionality
- Relevance scoring
- API error handling

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Ensure Dataset**: The test dataset is already created in `data/binaural-beats-dataset/`
2. **Run Flask App**: Start with `python app.py`
3. **Access Music Page**: Navigate to `/music` or use the Music link in the navigation
4. **Test Filtering**: Try different moods and filter combinations

## 🌟 Benefits

1. **Universal Mood Support**: All 6 moods now work effectively
2. **Scientific Accuracy**: Based on brainwave research and frequency therapy
3. **User Customization**: Advanced filtering for personalized experience
4. **Better Matching**: Relevance scoring ensures most appropriate tracks first
5. **Persistent Preferences**: Users don't lose their filter settings
6. **Performance**: Efficient sorting and filtering algorithms
7. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new moods, keywords, or audio types

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Duration-based filtering**: Filter by track length (30s, 5min, 15min+)
2. **Binaural beat frequency**: Filter by the actual binaural beat frequency
3. **User ratings**: Let users rate tracks for personalized recommendations
4. **Playlist creation**: Save combinations of tracks as playlists
5. **Integration with progress tracking**: Recommend based on user's wellness data
6. **Real audio integration**: Connect with actual binaural beats APIs
7. **Advanced search**: Full-text search across track metadata

## 💡 Technical Notes

- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Mobile Responsive**: UI adapts to different screen sizes
- **CSRF Protection**: All API calls include CSRF token validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse with request limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Logging**: All mood selections are logged for analytics
